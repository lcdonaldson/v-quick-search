### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve

# This project is under development.
  The base of this project comes from following Stephen Griders vue course. However, I modify some of the components to have different functionality and styles.

Some quick notes to run the project for yourself.

### 1. You need to add your own youtube api key
### 2. At this stage the pagination is just a placeholder, not actually functioning.
### 3. The SearchBar is currently set to make an api call on every keystroke. So have fun but don't wear out your api calls. This is one of the features being developed right now.
